# Gematria - machine learning for machine code

This repository will contain sources of Gematria, a framework for machine
learning on machine code, including source code of the [GRANITE
model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03894) for learning inverse throughput of
basic blocks.

We're still working on cleaning up the code. Please check again soon or follow
the repository to get a notification.
